# Time Based OTP App 

## Introduction

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) grants access only after presenting two or more pieces of evidence: knowledge, possession, and inherence.
- MFA protects user data from unauthorized access, even if a password is compromised.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra security layer by requiring an additional credential beyond the username and password.
